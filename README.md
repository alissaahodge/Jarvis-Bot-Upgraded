# Smart Bot (JARVIS Inspired)- `Using python`

Just like most of us, I started this project with inspiration from the Jarvis assistant in the classic classic iron man movies. I found this awesome API (Jarvis API linked below) and I was able to use this as a base for my Jarvis bot.
 
 Given the way the world is while i'm making this, I figured adding features that allow a user to query covid statistics or side effects covid etc. would be appropriate and useful right now :) 
- This is the Example script of how to use Python's Library JarvisAI (https://pypi.org/project/JarvisAI)

## Getting started-
1. Clone the repo.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all requirements, some of the things you may need to install manually so check requirements.txt file.
If anything is failing (or giving error) then skip that package or try to install that manually by searching on Google about that package.
3. Run `main.py` file. `python scripts/main.py`

#### If you encounter issue where Appkit won't install try

## virtual Environment Set Up Notes-   
Should you need to set up a virtual environment: 
First ensure you have virtual env package - `pip install virtualenv`
Then create your virtual environment - `virtualenv venv`
To activate the virtual environment created run `source venv/bin/activate`

## Usages-
You can use this bot to get information on:
- the weather
- covid-19 (cases, recoveries, deaths etc)
- ask it to open youtube or facebook
- ask for information on something try `what does wikipedia have about bears`


## Note-
* Though at the moment it does not support speech to text and text to speech,
this is something I will be adding in the future
